# Meow Gear Solid Dos. 
Meow Gear Solid Dos. A stealth, action, virtual reality (VR) game from Cal Poly Pomona undergraduate students.

## Overview

The word "Dos" in the name means "second" in Spanish, as this game will be developed upon and be the second version of the game "Tactical Espionage Kittens: Meow Gear Solid," a VR game which was built during Spring 2024 semester under Dr. Markus Eger--co-director of Cal Poly Pomona's Virtual Reality Lab.

Let us introduce you a little bit to the first version: Meow Gear Solid is a virtual reality game created by programming language C# in Unity Engine, and the user can enjoy it through the Meta Quest 2 headset. The game's objective is to test the playerâ€™s ability to strategically pass through the enemies without dying by using hints and equipment along the way.

For the second version, we will focus on implementing more haptic sensors, as we want to give the players better tactile experience in virtula reality.

# Meow Gear Solid Dos. 
Meow Gear Solid Dos. A stealth, action, virtual reality (VR) game from Cal Poly Pomona undergraduate students.

## Overview

The word "Dos" in the name means "second" in Spanish, as this game will be developed upon and be the second version of the game "Tactical Espionage Kittens: Meow Gear Solid," a VR game which was built during Spring 2024 semester under Dr. Markus Eger--co-director of Cal Poly Pomona's Virtual Reality Lab. Please check out [the link of old repo]

Let us introduce you a little bit to the first version: Meow Gear Solid is a virtual reality game created by programming language C# in Unity Engine, and the user can enjoy it through the Meta Quest 2 headset. The game's objective is to test the playerâ€™s ability to strategically pass through the enemies without dying by using hints and equipment along the way.

For the second version, we are working on our prototype right now, as of 08/30/2024. 

## Prototype
### Core Gameplay Mechanics
* #### Movement ####
  (how the player moves within the game) (still need to work on this as many students were confused and did not know how to use the controls during the Demo day) (need to put down more info on WALKING, PUNCHING, SHOOTING, KNOCKING ON THE WALL, THROWING, HIDING)
* #### Interaction ####
  If the player is in the sightline of the Dog Enemies, the Dog Enemies will leave their place and chase after the player. The player has options to deal with it: kill it by gun (add more heptic features), throw tennis ball at it (add in more physics features?!), knocking on the wall (definitely add in more physics and sound and heptics features)
* #### Rules ####
  (about winning/losing conditions) (need to define again the blood level and add in the flashcard/ "Kahoot" multiple choices features. 
  
## Game Objectives:
(Still need to define clear objectives and goals for the player to achieve). 
Right now, the goal is moving through the maze without being killed and have a fight with the Big Boss at the end (and not falling out of the 1st level's ground.) 
Still need to decide what is the goal for the second floor. Collect as many items as possible without being killed?! 
Goal for third floor (if the player ever makes it here.) Only able to use each items once and have limited ammunitions (still want to be able to import the "Kahoot" feature inside this floor.) (Answer questions correctly get more blood and more recovery pads?!) 

Aidan wants to fix and add in more inventories. Currently we have guns, healthpad (?!), the map on the hand, the tennis balls, the carton boxes served as inivisible shield. 
## Level Design 
Will ask Tyler if he can "widen" the pathways in Level 1 and make the architecture look more like Cal Poly Pomona. We can have different theme. "Haunted house"--scare theme (level 1). Thanksgiving (level 2). Christmas (level 3). Other ideas: for "non-violence/ healthy version" level 1: building 8. level 2: building 7. level 3: library. Don't want to associate shooting with school's environment. 
## User Interface (UI)
Need to develop a friendly UI for teachers/ users to import questions and answers in. Probably will accept .csv files?
